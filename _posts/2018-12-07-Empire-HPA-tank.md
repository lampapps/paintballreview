desc: A review of the Empire Carbon Fiber HPA
---

Empire makes a very basic tank that is great to start off with when you just started into paintball. Basic cabon fiber bottle with a basic regulator. nothing special, but its reliable. I use it as a spare tank.

##### What we like

Cheap and reliability.

##### What we do not like

It is just a basic tank, but it is cheap so cant really complain.

#### Bottom line

If you are on a low budget this is the tank for you.

##### Cost

Low cost.
