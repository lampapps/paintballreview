desc: A review of the ninja SL2 with pro v2 regulator
---

The Ninja SL2 air tank is Ninjaâ€™s best bottle with their best regulator. The v2 regulator has the adjustable bonnet. The purpose of the adjustable bonnet is so you can adjust were the fill nipple and gauge lays when screwing into the gun.

##### What we like

Super light bottle with Ninja's best regulator.

##### What we did not like

The cost of the HPA is pricey

##### Bottom line

You are going to pay top dollar for the best of the best.

##### Cost

Top dollar.
