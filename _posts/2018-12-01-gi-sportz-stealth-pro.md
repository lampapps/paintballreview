Planet Eclipse did a collaboration with GI Sportz to make an upgraded version of their Gtek 160r for the same amount of money. It is called [GI Sportz Stealth Pro][aws]. It is the same basic gun, but with many nice upgrades.

The upgrades are a POPS ASA which is one of the best on/off ASA on the market. Planet Eclipse uses it on their high end guns. 

The Stealth Pro also comes with the blade trigger already installed on the gun, and it has the low rise feed neck. The Stealth Pro also includes a 4-piece Empire driver XX Barrel kit (3 backs and 1, 14-inch tip). 

The 3 bore sizes are .684, .688, and .692. The .692 is pointless because .692 is way to big for the paintballs. Other than that everything else is the same between the Gtek 160r and the GI Sportz Stealth Pro.


##### What we like

comes with a barrel kit 
best bolt sytem in the paintball world

##### What we did not like

The AT pipes gets in the way of some for some people

##### Bottom line

Highly recommended paintball maker.

##### Cost 

Moderate cost
