desc: A Review of the First Strike Hero Guerrilla HPA Tank
---
First Strike Hero Guerrillas HPA Tank has to be the best bottle on the market, however the regulator sucks. The bottle is super light and they make them fatter then other tanks so you can have a larger size tank without the gun having to be further away from your shoulder.

The regulator is unreliable. I recommend that you replace all the O-rings and tighen all the bust disk. Or just buy a different regulator and put it on the the bottle.

##### What we like

* The super light bottle
* Fatter bottle so you can buy a bigger tank without being so far away from your gun
* The regulator is short
* The regulator has a no tool adjustable bonnet
 
##### What we did not like

The regulator is unreliable

##### Bottom Line

Buy if you know how to fix regulators or if you are going to put a different regulator on it.

##### Cost

Moderate cost.
