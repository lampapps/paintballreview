If you like a breathable mask but want more protection then the V-force Profiler is for you. Good breathability, good field of view, and good face and ear protection. The lens is easy to replace.

##### What we like

* Breathability
* Field of view
* Face and ear protection
* Ease of lens replacement

##### What we did not like

* Nothing, it is a good mask for the cost.

##### Bottom Line

Good buy for the cost.
