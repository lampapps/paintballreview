Ninja carbon Fiber HPA tank with the pro v2 regulator is a basic bottle with Ninja's best regulator on it. The pro v2 main upgrade is the adjustable bonnet.

Ninja, in general, makes the best HPA tanks in the paintball market. Always proven to work.

Nothing, it is great for the money.

##### Bottom line

Best bang for your buck.

##### Cost

Average price of about $180 on Amazon.
