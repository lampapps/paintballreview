desc: A Review of the First Strike Hero Guerrilla HPA Tank

First Strike Hero Guerrillas HPA Tank has to be the best bottle on the market, however the regulator is not the best. The bottle is super light and they make them fatter then other tanks so you can have a larger size tank without the gun having to be further away from your face.

For all other tanks a good size for most people is a 45/45 but for the first strike tanks a good size is a 77/45

The regulator is unreliable. I recommend that you replace a few O-rings and tighten all the bust disk.

##### What we like

* The super light bottle
* Fatter bottle so you can buy a bigger tank without being so far away from your gun
* The regulator is short
* The regulator has a no tool adjustable bonnet

##### What we did not like

The the O-rings on the regulator are unreliable

##### Bottom Line

great bottle but O-rings on regulator go bad quick, which is easy to fix
