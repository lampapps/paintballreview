If you like a breathable mask but want more protection then the JT Proflex, then the V-force Profiler is for you. 

Good breathability, good field of view, good face and ear protection. Easy to replace lens.

* Field of view
* Face and ear protection
* Ease of lens replacement
 
##### What we did not like

* Nothing, it is a good mask for the cost.

##### Bottom Line

Good buy for the cost.

##### Cost

Low to moderate cost.
