Ninja Carbon Fiber HPA tank is an all-around basic carbon fiber tank. The tank is a very reliable. It has been proven time and time again to always work. If you are playing paintball on a budget and want something a little better then the Empire carbon fiber tank then this Ninja tank is the one for you.

##### What we like

Low cost but very reliable. 

##### What we did not like

No adjustable bonnet.

##### Bottom line

Perfect if you want something a little nicer then a basic carbon fiber tank.

##### Cost 

Moderate cost.
