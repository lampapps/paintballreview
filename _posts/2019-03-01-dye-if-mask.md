desc: A Review of the Dye I5 Paintball Mask
---
I personally hate the Dye I5 because it fits close to face. If you like a close-fitting mask because it makes you feel more protected then buy it. There are many people that love the Dye I5.

Because the mask is close to the face it reduces the breathability and creates an echo when talking. What I like most about the mask is the head strap; it uses a ratchet strap system, which is very comfortable and super easy to adjust for the perfect fit. I like it so much I put the Dye I5 strap on my JT Proflex. Another thing I like about the I5 is that it is super easy to change the lens out.

##### What we like

* Strap
* Ease of lens replacement

##### What we did not like

* Echo
* I personally don't like the close fit to face

##### Bottom Line

Great mask if you like close fit and as a lot of cool colors
