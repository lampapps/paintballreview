---
The [EMEK 100][aws] is a mechanical gun, so it so not need batteries. The body is made from composite plastic. The composite plastic will not break. The bolt is the same as other more expensive gun from Planet Eclipse. 

##### What we like

The bolt system is super reliable, good consistently, and good air efficiency. For the money it is an amazing gun.

##### What we did not like

The only bad thing about the gun is there is no on/off ASA, which is not that big of a deal because you can buy one separately. The [EMEK 100][aws] requires more maintenance then other guns on the beginner gun list because the bolt has more parts and more O-rings you must clean and lube. In general, maintenance on paintball guns are very simple and easy to learn.

CAUTION: Use only compressed air, do not use Co2 in this paintball marker.

##### Features

##### Cost
