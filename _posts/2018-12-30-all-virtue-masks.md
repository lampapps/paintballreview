desc: A Review of all Virtue Paintball Masks
---

The reason I am putting all the Virtue masks in one review is because, to me, they all feel the same. They are all comfortable but the foam around the nose doesnâ€™t even touch my nose which makes it feel super lose on my face which I do not like. But on the other hand people like that feelng its all personal preference. Other then that the Virtue mask have OK breathability, good vision, and OK face and ear protection except for the Virtue Vio Extend which is a little bigger. That means better protection. All the Virtue masks have echo when talking. If you want to get the Virtue mask, then just pick the one you like the most. 

##### What we like

* Comfort
* Visibility
 
##### What we did not like

* feels lose around nose, which some people like  

##### Bottom Line

good mask

##### Cost

Moderate cost.
