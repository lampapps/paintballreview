If you want the most breathable mask on the market then the JT Proflex is for you. Super breathable, good face protection, and comfortable.  This mask does not have echo when talking. One cons is the ear protection is not that great. The lens is easy to change.

##### What we like

* Breathablitiy 
* No echo
* Easy lens change out
 
##### What we did not like

* Not good ear protection

##### Bottom Line

Good buy for the cost.

##### Cost

Low cost.
