desc: A review of the Empire Carbon Fiber HPA
---

Empire makes a very basic tank that is great to start off with when you just get started with paintball. This is a basic carbon fiber bottle with a basic regulator. nothing special, but it is reliable.

##### What we like

Cheap for a carbon fiber tank and reliable.

##### What we do not like

Nothing special about the tank other then that it is carbon fiber

##### Bottom line

If you are on a low budget this is the tank for you.
