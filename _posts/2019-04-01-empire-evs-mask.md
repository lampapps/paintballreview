desc: A Review of Empire EVS Paintball Mask
---
If you want a mask with the most field of view then the Empire EVS is just for you. This mask also has great face and ear protection.

Breathability is OK but has some echo when talking. Comfortable foam that is replaceable. It is easy to replace the lens.

##### What we like

* Best field of view
* face and ear protection
* Ease of lens replacement

##### What we did not like

* Some echoing when talking

##### Bottom Line

Recommended based on the field of view.
